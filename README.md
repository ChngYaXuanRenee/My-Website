Filled with interactable functions to make it functionable and accessible to gain the most insights of the tuition center and to be able to navigate easily around.

- As a Marketing Manager, I would like to have a clear site navigation that links to social media, so that I can gain more users in our socials from this tuition center, which helps in increasing the name of our tuition center.

My design process starts with me designing a simple and clear wireframe in adobe illustrator. I start of by choosing my colour scheme, and I stick with simple and non-contrasting colour to make it minimalistic and clear for users to read. This website is for all ages.  I went online to study about the features needed in my wireframe that focusses on a tuition center. In this ideation part, I want my project to have a place to express the overview of this tuition center, and an interactive tool to hover icons to browse images of the activity happen in this place. Featuring testimonial sections that allows this tuition center to be credible, and interactive disocunt codes for users. I will design a navigation area for linking with other socials to market our brand. Providing details of class hours in the website. My aim of this project is to achieve an ideal website structure, by making it mobile responsive, easy to navigate and neatly organized. I want to  maximize the effectiveness of their websites to inform and sell to prospective buyers online. I design in a mobile responsive way, highly functionable and meet my goal to ahceive from this website. Able to attract users to join the classes available.
