            of observation, determining form and composition, basic sketching and methods of modifying shapes/form, as a good draft 
            sketch is important before the oil painting, and finally start to apply oils to your canvas and pick up basic brush techniques 
            and colour blending skills, while starting to paint wet-on-wet!
